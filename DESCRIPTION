Description: A series of tools for extracting, wrangling, correcting, and visualizing 
     spatio-temporal atmospheric data, with an emphasis on fine particulate matter 
     (PM2.5, i.e. Particulate Matter with a diameter <2.5 Âµm) data from PurpleAir. 
     Correction factor equations from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
     and Lane Regional Air Protection Agency (LRAPA) are implemented to allow 
     for greatest data accuracy. Visualization functions have been carefully selected
     to maximize accessibility and data transparency.
